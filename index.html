If so, has it lost focus to the ad iframe? </p> <p> This achieves the desired effect, however it has to be implemented on the top-most document directly, rather than "on our side" inside the ad itself. </p> <p> Therefore this code has to be performed directly on the MillionKlick website. </p> </div> </div> <h3>"Ad" Iframe</h3> <iframe id="myTargetedIframe" src="/csb-krsm7v/src/iframe.html" scrolling="no"></iframe> <div id="focusStatus"></div> <ul id="log"></ul> </div> </div> <script src="/csb-krsm7v/index.f2eb6b64.js"></script> </body></html>
